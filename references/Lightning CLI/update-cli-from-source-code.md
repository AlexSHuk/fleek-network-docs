import Author from '@site/src/components/Author';

:::tip
Although the step-by-step instructions described here are simple to follow, this process is available as an automated script. To use it execute the following command in your server terminal and follow the instructions:

```sh
curl -sS https://get.fleek.network/update | bash
```
:::

## Switch to the installation user

Switch to the username you've used throughout the installation process.

```sh
su <USERNAME>
```

For example, if you used the username `lgtn` it'll look like the following command:

```sh
su lgtn
```

## Change directory to the source code

If you have installed it via the recommended process or instructions, then the default location where the [source code](https://github.com/fleek-network/lightning) is stored is `~/fleek-network/lightning`.

```sh
cd ~/fleek-network/lightning
```

:::tip
Notice that we use `~`, which refers to `$HOME`. You must use the username used for the installation process. For example, on [Ubuntu](/docs/node/requirements#server) if you used the username `lgtn`, the pathname for `$HOME` is `/home/lgtn`.
:::

## Pull the latest changes

To pull the latest changes use the `git pull` command, as follows:

```sh
git pull origin testnet-alpha-0
```
:::tip
If you get an error `error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge: Cargo.lock` you need to roll back the changes by running the command `git checkout Cargo.lock` and repeat step `git pull origin testnet-alpha-0`
:::
:::tip
We are using the branch named `testnet-alpha-0`, which is specific to the early testnet launch. Change to the correct branch name according to needs. For example, in the future the mainnet version will go on branch name `main`.
:::

## Build binary from the source

To build the binary from the source code, we execute the cargo build command:

```sh
cargo +stable build --release
```

## Update the symlink

Start by removing the existing one:

```sh
sudo rm -f "/usr/local/bin/lgtn"
```

Create a new symlink that links the new build binary to `/usr/local/bin/lgtn`, as follows:

```sh
sudo ln -s ~/fleek-network/lightning/target/release/lightning-node /usr/local/bin/lgtn
```

## Update the systemd service unit

Open and edit the `/etc/systemd/system/lightning.service` file.


1) Replace `<YOUR-USERNAME>` with the username. For example, in the [documentation](/docs/node/install#create-a-user) we use the username `lgtn`.

2) Make sure that the `ExecStart` is set correctly

```sh
[Unit]
Description=Fleek Network Node lightning service

[Service]
User=<YOUR-USERNAME>
Type=simple
MemoryHigh=32G
RestartSec=15s
Restart=always
ExecStart=lgtn run
StandardOutput=append:/var/log/lightning/output.log
StandardError=append:/var/log/lightning/diagnostic.log

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

When complete make sure the file is saved. Followed by a systemctl daemon reload:

```sh
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

## Restart the service

Once the cargo build process is completed, you have to restart the service. We're assuming you are using non-root user as [recommended](/docs/node/install#create-a-user), you won't use **sudo** to start the service. The command will look as follows:

```sh
systemctl restart lightning
```

:::tip
If you have installed the Fleek Network lightning manually, the [installation instructions](/docs/node/install#systemd-service-setup) recommended setting up a systemd service for the Fleek Network process. If you haven't, you're advised to check the instructions provided.

## Health checkup

Do a quick health check by running:

```sh
curl -w "\p" localhost:4069/health
```

If successful, you should get the response `OK`, as follows:

```sh
OK
```
