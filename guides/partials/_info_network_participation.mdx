Node participation can be true or false (online or offline) throughout an Epoch. Participation is in a transient state when the operator requests to opt in or out, and the network has yet to end the undergoing Epoch. Once the Epoch ends, the Node participation transitions to true or false. Therefore, a Node Operator can expect a Node state to be online, offline, opted in or out during an Epoch lifetime.

Before starting the service, make sure to opt-in or opt-out of network participation, through the available subcommand **opt** in the CLI.

The quickest way to find help is to run the help subcommand as follows:

```sh
lgtn opt help
```
