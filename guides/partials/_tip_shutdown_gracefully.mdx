Shutting down a Node after an Epoch can be tedious, given the remaining time an Epoch can take to end. Doing it prematurely, will cause reputation penalties, e.g. shutting down before the participation state change to offline. Therefore, a shutdown utility is available in the **Tools** menu option of `get.fleek.network`.

To access it, execute the command:

```sh
curl https://get.fleek.network | bash
```
