In the `/home/<USERNAME>/.lightning/config.toml` you'll find some and more of the following:

```toml
[BLANK]

[application]
db_path = "~/.lightning/data/app_db"

[consensus]
store_path = "~/.lightning/data/narwhal_store"

[fsstore]
root = "~/.lightning/blockstore"

[resolver]
store_path = "~/.lightning/data/resolver_store"

[signer]
consensus_key_path = "~/.lightning/keystore/consensus.pem"
node_key_path = "~/.lightning/keystore/node.pem"
```

:::tip
The configuration properties and values presented above are a shorter version of what you'll find on your **configuration.toml**. We keep it short to make it easier to follow, do not copy and paste.
:::

Find and replace all instances of ~ in the config file `/home/<USERNAME>/.lightning/config.toml`. 

Here's an example of how to do it using **sed**:

```sh
sed -i "s|~/.lightning|/home/<USERNAME>/.lightning|g" "/home/<USERNAME>/.lightning/config.toml"
```

:::tip
Replace the `<USERNAME>` with your username. For example, if you have followed the recommendation to [create a user](/docs/node/install#create-a-user) it would look like `/home/lgtn/.lightning/config.toml` for the username **lgtn**.
:::

For example, if your username is `lgtn` that'd look like this:

```sh
sed -i "s|~/.lightning|/home/lgtn/.lightning|g" "/home/lgtn/.lightning/config.toml"
```

Once modified, you can run a `cat` to see the content of the files to confirm it has been updated.

```sh
cat /home/lgtn/.lightning/config.toml
```

For our example where we opted in for the username `lgtn` that would look like:

```toml
[BLANK]

[application]
db_path = "~/.lightning/data/app_db"

[consensus]
store_path = "~/.lightning/data/narwhal_store"

[fsstore]
root = "~/.lightning/blockstore"

[resolver]
store_path = "~/.lightning/data/resolver_store"

[signer]
consensus_key_path = "~/.lightning/keystore/consensus.pem"
node_key_path = "~/.lightning/keystore/node.pem"
```

:::caution Warning
Bear in mind that we are keeping the content of the file short to make it easier to read and follow. The content of your configuration file should look slightly different, amongst these it should contain other properties and values. You should not copy and replace the content of your files with the ones presented here.
