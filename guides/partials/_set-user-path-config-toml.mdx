You should be following the [create a user](/docs/node/install#create-a-user-1) recommendation. For our example, we have the username `lgtn`.

:::tip
If you have chosen a different username, replace `lgtn` by the correct username you have selected.
:::

In the `config.toml` you'll find some and more of the following:

```toml
[BLANK]

[application]
db_path = "~/.lightning/data/app_db"

[consensus]
store_path = "~/.lightning/data/narwhal_store"

[fsstore]
root = "~/.lightning/blockstore"

[resolver]
store_path = "~/.lightning/data/resolver_store"

[signer]
consensus_key_path = "~/.lightning/keystore/consensus.pem"
node_key_path = "~/.lightning/keystore/node.pem"
```

Find and replace all instances of `~` in the config file `/home/lgtn/.lightning/config.toml`. Here's an example using `sed`:

```sh
sed -i "s|~/.lightning|/home/lgtn/.lightning|g" "/home/lgtn/.lightning/config.toml"
```

:::caution
The `config.toml` example below is a shorter version of what you'll encounter, yours might look different. We do this to keep the guide simple to read. Do not copy and replace with the version demonstrated here.
:::

Once changed, all the instances of `~/` should be replaced by your user path e.g. `/home/lgtn/`. For our example, the output would look like the following:

```toml
[BLANK]

[application]
db_path = "/home/lgtn/.lightning/data/app_db"

[consensus]
store_path = "/home/lgtn/.lightning/data/narwhal_store"

[fsstore]
root = "/home/lgtn/.lightning/blockstore"

[resolver]
store_path = "/home/lgtn/.lightning/data/resolver_store"

[signer]
consensus_key_path = "/home/lgtn/.lightning/keystore/consensus.pem"
node_key_path = "/home/lgtn/.lightning/keystore/node.pem"
```
