We recommend creating a `non-root` user with administrative privileges. It'll allow us to install any system requirements.

You can create a new user and add to the **sudo** group by running:

:::tip
For our example, we'll be using the name `lgtn` but you can pick whichever you'd like. If you already have a **sudoer** account, you can skip this step.
:::

```sh
sudo adduser lgtn
```

After completing the `adduser` steps, execute the `usermod` to add the `user` to the **sudo** group, as follows:

```sh
sudo usermod -aG sudo lgtn
```

Switch to the new **user** by using the command:

```sh
su lgtn
```

Change the directory to the new user's home, as follows:

```sh
cd /home/lgtn
```
