Node participation can be true or false (online or offline) throughout an Epoch. Participation is in a transient state when the operator requests to opt in or out, and the network has yet to end the undergoing Epoch. Once the Epoch ends, the Node participation transitions to true or false. Therefore, a Node Operator can expect a Node state to be online, offline, opted in or out during an Epoch lifetime.
