You can restore the keystore (Public Keys) by copying the directory to the `~/.lightning` directory.

Let's assume that you know where your backup directory or files are located. To keep our instructions easy to follow, let's say that:

1) The keystore and files are located under the hypothetical location `/my-keystore-backup`

2) The files in the `/my-keystore-backup` are the following:

```
/my-keystore-backup
├── consensus.pem
└── node.pem

1 directory, 2 files
```

Considering the above for our example, you would have to run the following command:

```
mv /my-keystore-backup /home/<YOUR-USERNAME>/.lightning/keystore
```

:::tip
Remember to replace the `<YOUR-USERNAME>` with the correct username for the setup. For example, if you have installed the Fleek Network with the username `lgtn` that would be `/home/lgtn/.lightning/keystore`.
