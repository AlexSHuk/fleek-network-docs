The Lightning CLI provides a wide range of capabilities, including running the node, accessing key management utilities, network participation management and printing the loaded configuration. 

Its user-friendly interface provides detailed information about each command through the **help** sub-command, making it easy to navigate and operate efficiently.

:::tip
A quick reference of frequently used commands are available for [native](/references/Lightning%20CLI/frequently-used-commands-for-native-setup) and [docker](/references/Docker/frequently-used-commands-for-docker-setup) setups.

## Commands

The commands are the interface in which users enter specific commands and options for the Fleek Network to process.

### Run

Run the full node

### Keys

Key management utilities to **show** (print the node's public keys) or **generate** private keys.

### Opt

The Opt command allows the user to opt into or out of Network participation. To opt-in, use the subcommand **in**, or opt-out of network participation by using **out**â€“note that this command should be sent before shutting down the node to avoid reputation penalties. To query the node participation status in the network, use the subcommand **status**.

### Print-config

Print the loaded configuration.

## Options

The Options flags allows further control or override default settings:

- `-c`, or `--config`, path to the toml configuration file which defaults to ~/.lightning/config.toml
- `--with-mock-consensus`, determines use of mock consensus backend
- `--with-console`, enable the Tokio Console asynchronous debugger
- `--with-log-locations`, enable code locations when printing logs
- `-v`, increases the level of verbosity (the max level is -vvv)

## Help

```sh
lgtn help
```

```sh
