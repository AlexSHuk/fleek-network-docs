Amongst other resources, ports play the role of managing and organizing network traffic. The ports initiate and terminate network connections crucial for the node to operate in the Fleek Network. The operating system should have the ports enabled and open for the node to run successfully.

We reserve the following top level ranges:

- TCP: `4200-4299`
- UDP: `4300-4399`

Each service in the node has 10 ports reserved within each range.

:::note
For node operators, they can either choose to individually open up the assigned ports, or just open the top level ranges, at their discretion. But we reserve the full ranges for future use, so they should avoid any port conflicts with other software running on the node.

:::tip
For the Node Operators who opt to run the `get.fleek.network` assisted installer, the ports are verified if in use.

The Node process requires the following ports:

### Connection Pool (`4x00-4x09`)

- Netkit QUIC: `4300 (UDP)`

### Consensus (`4x10-4x19`)

- Mempool: `4210 (TCP)`
- Primary: `4310 (UDP)`
- Worker: `4311 (UDP)`

### Handshake (`4x20-4x29`)

- HTTP: `4220 (TCP)`
- TCP: `4221 (TCP)`
- WebRTC: `4320 (UDP)`
- WebTransport: `4321 (UDP)`

### RPC (`4x30-4x39`)

- HTTP: `4230 (TCP)`
- WebSocket / WebTransport?

### DHT (`4x40-4x49`)

- UDP: `4340 (UDP)`

### Broadcast

- Uses connection pool

### Blockstore Server

- Uses connection pool

:::caution required
The ports should be freed before launching the node process. Any blockers or firewalls should be configured to enable the ports.
